Truong and his team add a  separate thread for logging

but he using while True like this

```python
def run():
    while True:
        # do something
```

the CPU load is always 100% all the time make request slow down alot

that the root reason

we trying to find the problem, most notably is we try to find the commit that cause the problem

by using git history visualized and using binary search to find it, the algorithm below will show it

```python
list_commits = []

left = 0
right = len(list_commits)
mid = (right - left) / 2

while (mid < right and mid > left):
    if list_commits[mid] is slow:
        right = mid
        mid = (right - left) / 2
    else:
        left = mid
        mid = (right - left) / 2

list_commits[mid] is the one that cause the problem
